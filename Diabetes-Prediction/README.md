# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy & Pandas
- Scikit-learn (SVM, accuracy, train_test_split)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

## 📌 Key Steps

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Splitting data into train/test sets
3. Scaling features with StandardScaler
4. Training an SVM model
5. Evaluating model performance
6. Visualizing confusion matrix
