# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a simple yet powerful machine learning model that predicts the **median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV)** using features from the **Boston Housing Dataset**. The goal is to understand and implement linear regression for real-world predictive tasks.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Boston Housing Dataset** contains information about various features of houses in Boston suburbs, such as crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, etc.  
We use this dataset to train a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation
