## ðŸ§  Rock vs. Mine Classification using Logistic Regression

This project uses **real-world sonar signal data** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to classify objects as either a **rock** or a **mine**.

Built using Python and **Logistic Regression**, this project helped me strengthen my understanding of **binary classification** techniques in machine learning and also helped youtube tutorial series.

- âœ… Preprocessed and split data into training/testing sets using **scikit-learn**
- âœ… Trained a **Logistic Regression** model to classify sonar signals
- âœ… Evaluated the model using accuracy score
- âœ… Made predictions on real sonar input data
